<br>
<h2><b>Who was Alan Turing?</b></h2>
<p>Alan Mathison Turing was computer scientist as he known <q>Creator of modern computing</q>. He was also mathematician, theoretical biologist, cryptanalyst and high distance runner. He was born on 23 June 1912, in London and he died on 8 June 1954.</p>

<br>
<h2><b>Education Life</b></h2>
<p>He went to a primary school which was called St Michael’s at 6 years old. At about 13 years old, he was sent to a famous and expensive public school named Sherborne School. In that school, his headmaster sent a mail to his parents: <q>If he is to stay at public school, he must aim at becoming educated. If he is to be solely a Scientific Specialist, he is wasting his time at a public school</q>. Then, he countinued to study on advanced problems. After Sherborne, he made Turing machine in King’s College, in Cambridge.</p>
<br>
<h2><b>Turing Machine</b></h2>
<p>It was invented by Alan Turing in 1936. A Turing machine is original idea of basic computer. Turing machine with the correct sat operations can calculate anything computable. Complexity or difficulty doesn’t matter.</p>
<br>
<p>It has a mechanism and that mechanism holds an eraser, a pencil, tape, chip and other simple computer parts. Tape works as data. Pencil and eraser set data. Other parts decide what must type and erase, <q>1</q> or <q>0</q>. When there is no orders left, machine stops. So by that machine you can see what are calculations and the correct answer on tape.</p>
<br>
<p>Turing machine has some kinds which are named universal, alternating, quantum, non-deterministic, read-only, read-only right moving, probabilistic, multitape, multi-track.</p>

<br>
<h2><b>Turing Test</b></h2>
<p>Turing test is a mentioned  word in Alan Turing’s article on a magazine named <q>Computer Machinery and Intelligence</q> at 1950. Behind the idea of Turing test is <q>Can a machine think like human?</q>. For example think about clever bots on internet, you ask questions to them and they answer. But can you separate them which answers you a human or a machine? If you can separate them, the machine would fail in Turing test.</p>
<br>
<h2><b>Breaking The Enigma Code</b></h2>
<p>At <abbr title="World War 2">WW2</abbr>, Alan Turing worked at government’s code-breaking department. He worked on breaking the code of Enigma machine which was used by Germans for cipher and analyse secret messages. Then, Turing created Bombe Enigma for helping to cryptanalyse Enigma faster.</p>
